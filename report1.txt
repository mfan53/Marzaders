Progress report #1:

We made a new proposal with a different game idea that we think we will be able
to finish in a shorter amount of time. Despite this, we have decided to carry
over the old working title, AirTraffic, but we have not decided on a team name
yet.

We have managed to implement bullet shooting, but it has a ton of bugs so we
decided to leave it commented out for this build.

Today we also implemented the ship, shields, and a moving floor. We plan on
implementing enemies by the end of next week, have some rudimentary UI in
place, and have shooting calpabilities.
