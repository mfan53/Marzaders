Progress report #2:

We still not have decided on a team name as we have not met up much over the past week but we still got a lot of good work done.

Michael implemented most of the menu GUI sans a few minor features. Yanek finished implemented shooting in the game along with different shooting modes and Darwin implemented basic enemy movement/architecture.

Next week we plan on implementing damage so that things die, adding spawning code for enemies, and making it so that the game has a defined start and end.
