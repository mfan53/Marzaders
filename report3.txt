Progress report #3:

We still not have decided on a team name.

Michael implemented the pause menu and various UI enhancements such as having
the game dim when the game is paused. Yanek implemented better bullet handling,
removing them from the game if they get too far away. Darwin attempted to
implement collisions but ran into a few problems. While the collisions do
technically work, that code has not been provided with this progress report as
it renders the game unplayable after 15 seconds.

Less work got done this week due to exams being administered in the last week
of school. We expect to get a lot more work done next week as there will be no
more class.
