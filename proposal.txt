Space Invaders
================================================================================

A multiplayer space invaders game where you play as a ship that needs to shoot
down enemies. Your goal is to earn the most points possible and stay alive for
as long as possible.

Levels will consist of an "endless" wave level where the game gets progressively
harder as the player survives each wave. The levels will be in 3D, where the
player shoots from behind a 2D grid of blocks. The player will control where the
ship goes using WASD or the arrow keys and the camera will be behind the ship
during the game. The UI will include information about the player's score and
lives or hp left.

The team members are Darwin Pek, Michael Fanelli, and Janek Lehr. Darwin will
primarily integrate bullet and networking code, Michael will primarily integrate
the UI and controls for the game, and Janek will primarily integrate the event
code.

In order to proceed onward with the project, we plan to refactor the networking
and event code. We also plan to spend significantly more time on this project
implementing more interesting and solid gameplay.
